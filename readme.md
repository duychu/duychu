## 😄 About

With more than 8 years of experience spreading from System to Automation engineer and DevOps engineer, I am good at automa-
tion skills, experienced in automation of test-cases using Python language, strong understanding networking concepts (TCP/IP,
L2, L3, HTTP, DNS, etc.) as well as CI/CD and DevOps mindsets. 

I am familiar with Agile development style/methodology and its

tices and open-sourced projects and apply it into work organization. My other interests are big data, data analytics, distributed-
computing and MLOps.
